# ALX Project Nexus

## ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for my backend engineering projects in the ALX ProDev program. The program focuses on building robust, scalable backend systems using modern technologies and best practices.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- Python programming language
- Django web framework
- REST API design and implementation
- GraphQL for flexible data querying
- Docker for containerization
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

### Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design**: Schema modeling, relationships, and optimization
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Working with async/await in Python
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing Redis and other caching solutions
- **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT, OAuth, and session management
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designing decoupled, scalable systems

### Challenges and Solutions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented token bucket algorithm
- **Database Bottlenecks**: Optimized queries and added indexing
- **Deployment Issues**: Created comprehensive CI/CD pipelines
- **Authentication Flows**: Integrated multi-factor authentication

### Best Practices and Takeaways
- Always write unit and integration tests
- Document APIs thoroughly using Swagger/OpenAPI
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Design for scalability from the beginning
- Security should be a priority, not an afterthought
